<p>This project is about programming a second version of my previous project about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. I'm looking for a better UI/UX, as well as a way of the user being able of changing the cell life/death parameters (check the previous version for information about this).</p>
